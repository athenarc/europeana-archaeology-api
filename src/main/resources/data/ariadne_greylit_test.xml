                    <dc:description>At Old Wolverton, the Grand Union Canal crosses the valley of the River Great Ouse on an embankment and aqueduct.  A temporary canal (with locks) was built so that the waterway could still be used while the aqueduct was  under construction.  Albion Archaeology was commissioned by Milton Keynes Council to undertake an archaeological evaluation of the line of the, now  infilled, temporary canal on the southern side of the river valley.  The purpose of the evaluation was to help inform an  interpretation project on this component of Milton Keynes&apos;&apos; industrial heritage. The Milton Keynes Archaeological Officer specified that the archaeological evaluation should comprise earthwork survey and trial excavation. The earthwork survey was undertaken to map and interpret surviving above ground elements of the temporary canal.  It was possible to subdivide the site into two areas: an embanked section of canal on the valley side, and a cut section on the valley floor.The results of the earthwork survey were used to formulate a trenching strategy.  This investigation was undertaken .  Initially, Trenches 1-4 focused on the lock and associated basin in the embanked section of the canal.  During a second phase of investigation Trenches 2 and 4 were extended and three additional trenches were used to test other elements of the canal earthworks.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Planning permission has been granted by Milton Keynes Council for the construction of a new dwelling block and area of hardstanding at 4-6 Union Street, Newport Pagnell.   The evaluation revealed two large late medieval/early post medieval pits, and a sequence of pits and structural remains that dated from the early post-medieval period into the Victorian era. The structural remains are likely to relate to outbuildings at the rear of house plots along the High Street.   Subsequent monitoring of construction groundworks, identified further archaeological features within the area of development. They comprised ditches and pits of probable medieval date and post-medieval features that included pits, a ditch, a demolition layer and three robbed out foundation trenches.    Modern features uncovered included levelling layers, pits, post-holes and robbed-out foundation trenches.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Albion Archaeology was commissioned to undertake the archaeological evaluation of approximately 80 hectares of land on the northern edge of Milton Keynes.  A geophysical (fluxgate gradiometer) survey was undertaken in two episodes between late August and early September 2004, targeting the three areas of proposed development within the eastern area.   In April 2007 Albion Archaeology undertook an archaeological field evaluation (trial trenching) on land at Stantonbury Park, Milton Keynes, on behalf of CgMs Consulting.The evaluation comprised the excavation of 85 trial trenches. The majority of the trenches contained the backfilled remnants of furrows with at least two medieval/post-medieval field systems being identified within the development area.  The remaining archaeological remains were concentrated within the north-western part of the development area.  They consisted of ditches and gullies with the occasional pit and posthole.  The majority of the features were undated.    Two field boundary ditches, a drainage gulley and a shallow depression were dated to the mid-late Iron Age.  The overall paucity of artefacts and occupational debris would suggest that these remains were not located in the immediate vicinity of a domestic settlement but on its periphery.  They were probably associated with farming activities.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>An evaluation and desk-based assessment was undertaken in order to better understand the past landscape within which the site is located.     The trial excavation stage of the evaluation was undertaken in October 2004.  Three trenches were excavated. Despite the proximity of the modern course of Ermine Street, and the possibility that the ancient route could have crossed the site, no traces were found of the Roman road, or any roadside settlement.  Further investigation was undertaken.  This evaluation focused on the central area of a site excluded from an earlier investigation.    The investigation indicated that disturbance associated with the erection of the standing buildings was minimal, with the pre-existing soil profile having been buried beneath deposits associated with construction of the buildings.  The only possible archaeological feature was identified in this area and may be the southern edge of a post-medieval quarry pit.    The evaluation of the central area revealed that no features earlier that the post-medieval period were present.  As construction of the standing buildings had resulted in minimal disturbance, the results of the evaluation provide a reliable indication of the likely survival of archaeological remains.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>The evaluation consisted of the excavation of three trial trenches to determine the date, character and extent of any archaeological remains.  The trenches were laid out in accordance with a trench location plan, agreed with the Assistant County Archaeological Officer.    No archaeological evidence of human occupation, preceding the 11th century AD, was encountered during the evaluation, other than residual sherds of Roman and Iron Age pottery from Trench 1. The proximity, however, of late Iron Age/Roman industrial features and possible settlement evidence some 4m to the north of the evaluated land, within the Bridgeman Joinery site, implies that features of this date may lie at the northern extent of the study area.  Medieval evidence was concentrated in the south of the study area in Trench 1, in the form of an infilled ditch cutting a buried cultivation soil which had infilled a relict stream channel. The infilling and disuse of the ditch dated to between the 11th century and the early 13th century AD, while the buried cultivation soils can be viewed as being somewhat earlier in date (possibly late Saxon). They probably represent headland deposits generated by the turning of the plough at the end of a furrow to the west of the stream.  The archaeological remains within the study area may contribute to addressing issues of changing land-use and settlement pattern between the late Saxon and early medieval period.  The medieval feature, by virtue of its relationship to the infilled stream, represents archaeological deposits of regional importance and significance.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>During September 2005 Albion Archaeology undertook a programme of archaeological observation, investigation, recording, analysis and publication.  The work was occasioned by the construction of an additional car park at Bury Court, Church Lane, Bedford.  The construction involved ground disturbance in the form of the removal of overburden and the excavation of a soakaway.    The site of the proposed car park lies within the confines of the medieval village of Goldington  less than 150m to the south-east of the 15th century church of St Mary&apos;&apos;s.    The limited disturbance which accompanied the construction of the car park revealed the foundations of a late 19th-century extension to Goldington Bury, a mansion house which was demolished prior to the construction of the Bury Court tower block.  The excavation of the soakaway exposed evidence for modern disturbance.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>In June 2004 a service trench was excavated as part of maintenance work at All Saints Church, Renhold, Bedfordshire. The trench was for a new electrical supply to the church. The work forms part of an overall programme of work began in 2002 when drainage work along the northern side of the building was monitored by Albion Archaeology (Albion Report 2002/55).   The work was carried out in two episodes and was monitored on two occasions, on 12th May and 27th May 2004.  Excavation of the trenches was carried out by the site contractors with an archaeologist in attendance to examine the trenches when fully excavated  The result of the observations demonstrated that the buttresses of the tower are built on foundation rafts extending beyond the footprint of the buttress proper.  The soil observed to the west of the tower suggests that this, below superficial surface make-up layers, consists of undisturbed natural stratum.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Albion Archaeology was commissioned to carry out the archaeological observation and prepare a report on the results.  The development site is centred on NGR SP 9881 5004.  It is located to the east of Wick End Farm, at 60m OD within the valley of the River Great Ouse.  The proposed barn lies within an area covered in hardcore used for the parking of vehicle.  The land was formerly pasture.  No previous archaeological investigation had taken place in the development area.   No significant archaeological features or artefacts were revealed during the works.  Topsoil and subsoil had clearly been previously removed down to the underlying drift geology (boulder clay) during the creation of the vehicle parking area.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>In November 2003 Albion Archaeology attended the excavation of ground-works and footings in advance of the construction of a new classroom at Ursula Taylor Lower School, Clapham, Bedfordshire.    A programme of archaeological observation, investigation and recording was then undertaken during the ground-works phase of construction.   The remains of a probable NW-SE aligned, shallow ditch were identified within the development area.  This ditch is of indeterminate function but may represent some sort of boundary feature, possibly related to the manor house or medieval settlement excavated in 1987.  The remains were moderately well preserved with evidence of later root damage.     The conditions and nature of the construction work prohibited a clearer understanding of their function and extent. As a probable boundary ditch, with potential associations with known medieval settlement activity, these remains are considered to be of local significance</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>In April 2002 Albion Archaeology attended the excavation of ground-works and footings in advance of the construction of a new classroom at Wrestlingworth Lower School.    The remains of a possible early medieval post-built structure or fence corner were identified. These remains may have been associated with the medieval village of Wrestlingworth.  However, the conditions, size and nature of the construction work prohibited a clearer understanding of their function and extent.  The remains also appeared to have been heavily truncated by modern activity and were in a moderate state of preservation.   The identified post-medieval structural remains probably represent the foundations for an earlier, probably 19th-century, phase of the school buildings.  They were relatively well preserved.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Planning permission has been granted by Milton Keynes Council for the construction of a new dwelling block and area of hardstanding at 4-6 Union Street, Newport Pagnell.   The evaluation revealed two large late medieval/early post medieval pits, and a sequence of pits and structural remains that dated from the early post-medieval period into the Victorian era. The structural remains are likely to relate to outbuildings at the rear of house plots along the High Street.   Subsequent monitoring of construction groundworks, identified further archaeological features within the area of development. They comprised ditches and pits of probable medieval date and post-medieval features that included pits, a ditch, a demolition layer and three robbed out foundation trenches.    Modern features uncovered included levelling layers, pits, post-holes and robbed-out foundation trenches.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>An evaluation and desk-based assessment was undertaken in order to better understand the past landscape within which the site is located.     The trial excavation stage of the evaluation was undertaken in October 2004.  Three trenches were excavated. Despite the proximity of the modern course of Ermine Street, and the possibility that the ancient route could have crossed the site, no traces were found of the Roman road, or any roadside settlement.  Further investigation was undertaken.  This evaluation focused on the central area of a site excluded from an earlier investigation.    The investigation indicated that disturbance associated with the erection of the standing buildings was minimal, with the pre-existing soil profile having been buried beneath deposits associated with construction of the buildings.  The only possible archaeological feature was identified in this area and may be the southern edge of a post-medieval quarry pit.    The evaluation of the central area revealed that no features earlier that the post-medieval period were present.  As construction of the standing buildings had resulted in minimal disturbance, the results of the evaluation provide a reliable indication of the likely survival of archaeological remains.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Mid Beds District Council granted planning permission for the demolition of an existing greenhouse and construction of a new car port and garage at Newbury Manor, Ampthill Road, Silsoe, Bedfordshire.  The proposed development lay within a scheduled complex of medieval earthworks.    he Scheduled Ancient Monument at Newbury Farm comprises two medieval moated enclosures, associated leats and fish ponds (National Monument No. 11548).  Groundworks within the scheduled area included the demolition of a modern greenhouse, machine excavation of fourteen holes for the footings for the garage and topsoil stripping of the driveway immediately to the north-west.      Within the area of the driveway late medieval / post-medieval make-up layers were revealed.  Cut into these layers were seven features dating to the late medieval / post-medieval and post-medieval periods.  They comprised brick walls, brick-lined drains, a sandstone wall and a posthole alignment that are likely to be associated with the use of Newbury Manor in the late medieval and/or post-medieval periods.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>The construction of a new building is proposed at Twinwoods Business Park, Twinwoods Road, Clapham, Bedfordshire.  Albion Archaeology was commissioned by CgMs to undertake a programme of trial trenching, the results of which are presented in this report.  No archaeological remains are recorded in the Bedfordshire Historic Environment Record within the development area.  However, there are records of Iron Age, Roman, medieval and modern activity in the vicinity of the site.   No significant archaeological remains were identified by the trial trenching.  Despite the presence of modern features in two of the trenches, the area evaluated had not been significantly truncated by modern activity.  The absence of evidence for activity earlier than the post-medieval period, therefore, suggests a genuine lack of significant archaeological remains within the evaluated area.  It is reasonable to extrapolate that the development area as a whole has negligible archaeological potential.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>The evaluation took place within the grounds of Bromham Mill (HER 1029) and the mill house garden, close to extant 18th-19th century structures which formed part of this long-lived mill.   Previous investigations (Albion Archaeology 2002) revealed undated, truncated structural remains within the &apos;&apos;yard&apos;&apos; area of the PDA (immediately north of its entrance on Stagsden Road).  These were interpreted as the remains of former buildings associated with the mill.  Bromham Mill and the land adjacent to the bridge has also been considered as the putative site of the Bromham chantry chapel (founded in AD1295 and dedicated to St Mary and St Katherine).    Within the mill house garden, the evaluation revealed part of an undated structure and a post-medieval ditch containing a small quantity of 17th-18th  century pottery.  A post-medieval wall and a number of broadly contemporary surfaces associated with the pre-1883 mill were also revealed within the extant hovel building.  These are considered to be of local significance.      The undated structural remains may be part of Bromham chantry chapel.  If so, the identification of surviving elements of the chapel is of regional significance as its actual physical location has never been conclusively demonstrated before.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Elite Property Services was advised by the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority&apos;&apos;s Senior Conservation Archaeologist that an archaeological field evaluation was required to help assess the impact of a proposed new domestic dwelling adjacent to the Manor House at Airton. Albion Archaeology was commissioned to undertake the evaluation.    The site lies immediately north of the Manor House, in the centre of Airton. It comprises a vacant plot overlooking the village green, on a relatively level terrace.    The underlying geology consists of boulder clay over Carboniferous limestone. There has been a considerable build-up of cultivated garden soil on the site, following its previous use as an orchard, and spoil from adjacent ground-works has been stockpiled there since 2006.    Airton is recorded in Domesday; its name denotes a farmstead on the River Aire. Ordnance Survey maps depict the site as open ground; buildings shown on the Jefferys map in the 1770s may be the result of cartographic stylisation. The adjacent Manor House is Grade II listed and dates from the early 19th century, or possibly earlier. The house is fairly modest in proportion, and it is possible that the name &apos;&apos;Manor House&apos;&apos; may simply be an affectation.     The evaluation revealed the north-western corner of a cobbled surface at the southern edge of the development area, which had been cut into the hillside. A probable modern garden wall foundation cut through the cobbled surface, while another modern feature lay immediately north of it.    The remains are considered to be of local interest, with no regional or national significance.    The artefacts recovered did not merit retention, and have been discarded.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>A planning condition placed on the construction of a new grain store at Scotland Farm required the implementation of a programme of archaeological works.  Albion Archaeology was commissioned to undertake an archaeological field evaluation.   A reassessment of  aerial photographic evidence that was undertaken as part of this project provisionally suggested that the crop-marks were non-archaeological in nature.  Scotland Farm is believed to have been a settlement since the medieval period. The development area was evaluated in six trenches.  They revealed the remains of late Iron Age activity, medieval ridge and furrow earthworks and two modern ditches.  One of the Iron Age ditches appeared to correspond to the crop-mark crossing the development area.   The archaeological remains in the east of the development area were sufficiently deep to be preserved in situ, whereas those in the west of the area were threatened by the proposed development.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Albion Archaeology was commissioned to carry out archaeological observation of improvement works at All Saints&apos;&apos; Church, which stands at the north-western edge of the village of Turvey, seven miles west of Bedford. The improvement works comprised the installation of kitchen and toilet facilities within the base of the tower, which involved the removal of the wooden floor in the tower and the excavation of service trenches. The attendance of an archaeologist had been requested by the Diocesan Archaeological Advisor.    The village of Turvey is Anglo-Saxon in origin, with Turvey Manor mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. All Saints&apos;&apos; Church is also known to predate the Conquest of 1066; part of its original nave is still extant. The church was subsequently expanded and altered on numerous occasions between the early 13th and late 16th centuries, with the last major programme of structural alteration taking place in 1852.    No features or deposits of archaeological significance were revealed during the course of the improvement works. A likely reason for this is that the service trenches were not deep enough to encounter archaeological remains. The depth of soil observed in the churchyard may indicate that the subsoil represents a layer of made ground.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Mid Bedfordshire District Council granted planning permission for the change of use from a dwelling to a day nursery at Ruxox House. A planning condition was placed on the associated creation of car-parking spaces, requiring the implementation of a programme of archaeological investigation.  Albion Archaeology was commissioned to undertake archaeological observation of the ground-works. Ground-works for the creation of the car-parking spaces comprised the removal of topsoil to a maximum depth of 0.2m. The upper horizon of the underlying subsoil was exposed sporadically, but no archaeological features were revealed. The shallow nature of the ground-works means that any archaeological remains that may exist within the development site have been preserved in situ beneath the development.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>In July 2004 Albion Archaeology undertook an archaeological field evaluation on Land at Victoria Allotments, West Street, Dunstable, Bedfordshire on behalf of Dunstable Town Council.   The aim was to establish the extent and condition of any archaeological remains located within the study area in advance of a planning application to extend the boundaries of the current cemetery.  The evaluation would also allow an appropriate mitigation strategy to be developed.  The site lay close to the  historic core of Dunstable.  A small Roman town, known as Durocobrivis,  existed at this location and developed at the crossroads of a Roman road known as Watling Street and a prehistoric routeway known as the Icknield Way.    Three trenches were opened comprising a total area 72.10m2.    Within Trench 1 a series of wheel ruts were recorded, indicating the presence of a well rutted track or road which had formerly existed at this location.  It is suggested that these are likely to be the remains of part of the Icknield Way which is believed to have been located along the same line as modern-day West Street.  Therefore, the existence of wheel ruts on this site has added significance.  Trench 2 contained a ditch from which an unabraded sherd of early Roman pottery was recovered.  On this basis it is suggested that this ditch may have lined the Icknield way during the Roman period.    Trench 3 contained no significant archaeological features.  This evaluation has been extremely valuable in identifying a likely section of the Icknield Way, one of the oldest communication routes in Britain.  By so doing it has augmented our overall knowledge of this route and its relationship with the town of Dunstable.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>In January 2005 Albion Archaeology was commissioned, to undertake a programme of archaeological investigation during the  construction of a new parish room at the Church of St Peter, Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire.   This involved works adjacent to the north wall of the church. A brief had been issued by the Diocesan Archaeological Advisor (DAA) for a scheme of archaeological investigations (DAA 2004).  This stated that the archaeological works should include:  Field evaluation of the churchyard within the footprint of the development.  Archaeological observation during work undertaken by exhumation contractors and during groundworks required as part of the development.  Building recording of the upstanding fabric affected by the development.  This programme of observation and evaluation demonstrated that the development area had been subject to significant disturbance due to the excavation and construction of several post-medieval crypts and graves.  Despite this, several relatively shallow, unmarked burials were recorded in &amp;quot;islands&amp;quot; between the post-medieval graves.  It is suggested that these shallow graves constitute an earlier, possibly medieval, phase of burial within the churchyard.  Building recording of parts of the church affected by the development gave an opportunity to understand the development of the northern part of the building. Observations made during this project supported, and extended, the previous work undertaken at this site (Collett-White unpublished).  The main findings were that the original 13th and 14th century building had survived in places, although it had been altered several times.  The most noticeable alterations dated to the 17th century and the 20th century.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>In June 2007 Albion Archaeology undertook an archaeological field evaluation (trial trenching) on land at 1 Dove Lane, Harrold, Bedfordshire.  The proposed development area is located at the centre of the village of Harrold.  The development area has been evaluated using a single trench.  This revealed the remains of a walled structure a partial floor surface, drain and a well. Contemporary soil layers were also revealed.  All of these remains are considered to have been in use during the post-medieval period and the soil layers would have formed partly as a result of associated human action.  Collectively, it is suggested that these remains are consistent with those of a yard/garden area to the rear of a property fronting the High Street.  Such remains are of relatively low archaeological significance.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Albion Archaeology undertook an archaeological watching brief on behalf of English Heritage.  The work was occasioned by the laying of a replacement pipeline to supply the fountain within the grounds of Wrest Park Gardens.  This involved the digging of a trench along the course of the existing pipeline.  Within the pipe trench, demolition layers and a brick culvert were revealed.  These were located in the area of the earlier house, as marked on 18th century maps, and the location of the culvert matched that of a previously mapped parch mark that has been tied in with plans of the previous house.  A brick cistern or possible ice house was also revealed and is likely to be contemporary with the earlier house.  The existing pipeline was likely to be associated with the supply of garden features dating from the late 18th and 19th centuries.  The Watching Brief has increased our knowledge of features associated with the earlier development of Wrest Park.  It has also demonstrated the significant potential for the survival of buried archaeological features that may provide evidence for the historical development of the gardens.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>The scheduled moats east of Hill Hall, Old Warden, have been the subject of a programme of research funded by the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund and Tarmac Ltd.    As part of that work the earthworks within the area of the scheduled monument were surveyed in January 2008.  The results of the survey, considered in the light of previous documentary analysis, enable the formulation of a possible sequence of development of the moated complex, and highlight the probable medieval origin of the silted fishponds in the wooded compartment.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>A new communications cable was to be installed adjacent to Chicksands Priory scheduled ancient monument which lies within the grounds of the Defence Intelligence and Security Centre, Chicksands, Bedfordshire.   The DCMS consented to the works subject to them being accompanied by a programme of archaeological observation, investigation and reporting.  The limited nature of the building works associated with the installation of the communications cable meant that they had very little impact on deposits that had the potential to contain archaeological remains.  Although some sandstone was encountered at a relatively shallow depth, because only a small surface area of this material was exposed it was not possible to say whether it formed part of the remains of larger structure or was just a rubble deposit.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>A planning application was submitted to Bedfordshire County Council for a residential development at 35 Chapel Lane, Willington, Bedfordshire.      The development site lay within a landscape rich in archaeological remains and there was high potential that the site contained hitherto unknown archaeological evidence.    As a consequence, a condition was attached to the planning permission requiring that a programme of archaeological works comprising observation, investigation and recording be carried out as part of the development.       The archaeological works identified a number of features within the area of the development that have been interpreted as modern.  The features included a quarry pit, a ditch, pits and other features that were probably associated with recently demolished buildings.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Archaeological investigations were undertaken during November 2005 by Albion Archaeology in advance of a new access route, associated with the Bletchley Landfill site.  The site comprised the area of a proposed roundabout and is located to the south-west of Bletchley.   An area of c. 0.2ha was mechanically stripped of topsoil and subsoil under archaeological supervision.  Following the removal of the overburden the area was subsequently examined for archaeological remains.  Any sub-surface features encountered were subjected to hand excavation in order to ascertain their nature and date.     A small range of archaeological features were recovered comprising a pit, two postholes, six tree-throw holes and two furrows.  The pit and postholes occurred towards the centre of the site within an area of 10m.  Some of the features contained charcoal flecks and one contained a broken flint flake.  However, while they may be broadly contemporary and could be associated with the flint scatter identified during fieldwalking, the absence of firm dating evidence makes this uncertain.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>The programme of archaeological observation and recording was undertaken in May 2007. During this period, all groundworks which required monitoring were completed.  The groundworks comprised the removal of topsoil for the access road and car park.  No archaeological features were revealed during the works. The removal of only topsoil from most of the area has ensured that if archaeological remains exist within the site, they remain preserved in situ beneath the development.</dc:description>

The Diocesan Archaeological Advisor issued a brief , recommending that the work be observed archaeologically in case there was a need to record evidence discovered or disturbed by it.  Albion Archaeology was invited by the project architect, acting on behalf of the Parochial Church Council, to undertake archaeological monitoring of the ground disturbance during insertion of the new gas pipe.  The results of the observations demonstrate that the course of the pipe trench initially ran on undisturbed geological strata, first gravel and then clay.  As it neared the church and as the clay dipped down, the trench was dug into a relatively modern layer of made ground seemingly filling the drop in ground level.    No archaeological features, in situ burials, or artefacts of archaeological significance were revealed in the course of the work.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Trial trenching took place in order to assess the reliability of results from previous assessment works and to provide additional information on date, nature and preservation.  Six trial trenches, totalling 600m2, were targeted on ditch- and pit-type geophysical anomalies.  The trial trenching has investigated three archaeological sites which were initially identified by geophysical survey.  It has provided some information on their date, nature and level of preservation.  However, their full extent and any spatial variations within them are still unknown.  This could only be achieved by further trial trenching at a higher percentage coverage.  In addition, because non-intrusive survey, which has been undertaken extensively along the route, is notorious for under-representing the sub-surface archaeological features, additional sites may exist within the road corridor which can only be located by more extensive, arrayed trial trenching.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Albion Archaeology was commissioned to undertake the archaeological evaluation of a site, in the medieval settlement of Lavendon.  A total of three trial trenches were opened.  The evaluation revealed that the demolition of the cottages and subsequent creation of the Highways depot had not significantly damaged the archaeological remains.   Two undated features where identified below deposits associated with the construction and use of the cottages.  An undated boundary ditch, orientated roughly north-south was recut on several occasions.  Further north in the central part of the site, perpendicular pitched limestone footings for walls of a building were identified, sealed beneath a horizontal layer of limestone fragments and crushed lime mortar.   This would appear to define an earlier though undated phase of occupation of the site.  A limestone culvert truncated the associated demolition spread, though again, the contrasting alignment to the cottages may suggest that it was not associated.  The construction of the cottages fronting Olney Road resulted in a significant modification to the site.  It is possible that at this time the terrace, aligned parallel to Olney Road was created, cutting into the rising ground to the east. To the rear of the cottages the external surfaces associated with the northern and southern cottages contrasted, with pitched limestone fragments in the north, whilst horizontal limestone slabs were replaced by tarmac in the south.   The evaluation indicates that the site had been utilised for an extended period of time, with evidence for a substantial boundary ditch and foundations for a building which predated the cottages.  The cottages which occupied the site until the 1950s were part of an extensive row of uniform appearance.  The features suggest that these were all constructed as a single development in the mid 19th century.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>A faculty was issued for works of repair to the Church of St Mary&apos;&apos;s Aston subject to English Heritage requirements.  English Heritage asked for an assessment of the significance of the east face of the tower in order to inform decisions about the extent and methods of repair.  A visual inspection of the tower, and the presence of vertically-set rectangular stones within the fabric, had raised the possibility that remnants of earlier construction might be present. A series of medium format monochrome photographs was taken of the east face of the tower for the production of rectified, scale images.  Additional colour photographs were taken of the east and the other faces of the tower.  To aid interpretation, digital photographs were also taken.      The masonry details on the tower suggest that it represents a single phase of construction.  The string courses that define each stage of the tower are continued across the junction of the masonry with the buttresses.  Elements of the masonry, found at the angles between the tower and buttresses, straddle that junction.  This, taken together with the evidence of the string courses, suggests that the tower is likely to be of one build.  Pevsner suggests that the tower is of fifteenth century date, presumably based on the date of features such as the west door.  Whilst later features can be inserted into earlier structures, the integration of features such as the spiral stair and buttresses with the string courses are all consistent with the suggested fifteenth-century construction date for the tower.     Please note that although the report on the recording is described as an interim report, no further work was deemed necessary and the repair work proceeded on the Tower.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>In October 2007, Albion Archaeology carried out an archaeological field evaluation on land at The Lawns, Kings Walden Road, Great Offley, Hertfordshire.  The 0.4ha evaluation area lies within the centre of Great Offley.  Great Offley is potentially an important medieval settlement.  It is recorded in the Domesday Book and the Historic Environment Record notes that Offley has Anglo-Saxon origins.  There is also a tradition that King Offa of Mercia built a palace at Offley, and the village was named for him as &apos;&apos;Offanlege&apos;&apos;.   The evaluation comprised the excavation of six trial trenches covering approximately 200m&amp;#178; in area.  Between 0.3m and 0.7m of overburden was removed from the trenches down to the undisturbed geological deposits.  No archaeological features were encountered.  A small quantity of abraded medieval pottery was recovered from the topsoil.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>An archaeological watching brief was undertaken during groundworks that were part of streetscape improvements within Church Square, Bedford. The site is located in central Bedford, within the limits of the original Saxon burh, hence in an archaeologically sensitive area.  Layers of buried soil were observed in the eastern part of the square dating from the mid 12th century to early 19th century. One of those deposits contained residual Saxo-Norman pottery. The finds assemblage as a whole testify to a continuity of settlement from the Saxo-Norman period till present day in the area. The foundations of at least two 19th century houses, as well as a 19th century street- or yard surface were also uncovered, preserved beneath modern levelling and make-up layers. Remains of 19th century and later features are likely to survive under the current square, though heavily disturbed. Earlier layers and features are most likely to survive relatively undisturbed in the eastern part of Church Square.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>An earthwork survey was required by the Bedfordshire County Archaeological Officer  in order to establish the extent and condition of ridge and furrow earthworks in Archaeology Areas 5 and 6 of The Wixams development area.  Albion Archaeology was commissioned by RPS Planning (the Wixams Historic Environment project managers), on behalf of Gallagher Estates, to undertake the survey and prepare a report on the results   This survey was designed to characterise the remnant ridge and furrow field systems and allow their importance to be assessed.  Areas 5 and 6 lie on the hinterland of known medieval settlement cores at Wilstead and Duck-End.  Therefore, it was not unexpected that this land would have formed part of the land exploited for agricultural purposes during that period.  The survey has recorded the remnants of medieval ridge and furrow earthworks present in those fields and reviewed the results in the light of extant historical map evidence.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>During July 2005 Albion Archaeology undertook a programme of archaeological observation, investigation, recording, analysis and publication. This was undertaken during groundworks for an extension at Church End Lower School, Marston Moretaine, Bedfordshire.  This involved groundworks in order to remove overburden and the excavation of footings ahead of construction.   A medieval boundary ditch was observed within the footings, demonstrating the high archaeological potential of the area. The NW limits of the modern overburden were ascertained which could assist in establishing the archaeological impact of any future works within the vicinity.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Planning permission has been granted for the construction of a residential development on land south of Potton Road, Biggleswade, Bedfordshire.  Prior to the recent work no archaeological remains were known within the site, but it lies within a region of known archaeological activity and a landscape containing significant prehistoric ceremonial and funerary remains.   Eight trenches representing a 2% sample of the site were opened.  Archaeological features were found in six of the trenches but in most cases these were single isolated pits or ditches.  Only in one trench in the northern corner of the site was there a concentration of remains. These comprised four pits, three of which probably date to the late Neolithic (c. 2700-2000 BC).  One of the isolated features is datable to the late Bronze Age/early Iron Age.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>South Bedfordshire District Council granted planning permission, for the change of use of allotment gardens to cemetery use at the Victoria Allotments, West Street, Dunstable.  A condition attached to the planning permission required the implementation of a Scheme of Archaeological Resource Management (SARM) as a consequence of the development.  Bedfordshire County Council&apos;s Archaeological Officer (CAO) issued a Brief, which was designed to secure the implementation of a programme of archaeological resource management in fulfilment of that condition.  Groundworks required as part of the change involved removal of overburden within the footprint of a new access road and footpath, which were the focus of the archaeological mitigation.  A single adult inhumation burial (probably of Roman date) represents the earliest remains found.  The grave contained no dateable artefacts, although it pre-dated a series of wheel ruts some of which cut into the upper fill of  the grave.  The wheel ruts form an extensive group of parallel ruts aligned ENE to WSW; they represent the remains of a wide, un-metalled trackway.    The latest archaeological feature was a ditch aligned ENE to WSW situated on the boundary between the rutted track and the terrace slope.  This contained modern (19th/20th century) debris.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>A planning application for the construction of almshouses on land at the rear of 13 Bedford Street Woburn.   The southern and western parts the evaluation revealed the remains of post-medieval and modern activity in the form of ditches, pits and structures of probable Georgian date.  In the north-eastern part of the site were the remains of late medieval/early post-medieval field systems were encountered.  Also in the north-eastern part of the evaluation, evidence was revealed for Roman settlement from the1st-3rd centuries AD.  This included evidence for late 1st-early 2nd century industrial pottery production in the form of wasters, seconds, fragments of kiln discs/plates and large quantities of pottery.  The discovery of 1st-3rd century Roman settlement and industrial activity has pushed back the origins of Woburn by almost one thousand years and it represents the discovery of a hitherto unknown Roman settlement in the eastern region.  Despite the evident plough truncation within the area, the presence of a nearby kiln cannot be ruled out.  Similarly, the presence of 2nd-3rd century brick demonstrates the potential for significant structures in the vicinity.  These remains are considered to be of regional significance and have the potential to significantly add to our knowledge of Roman settlement and local pottery production in Bedfordshire and the east of England.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Sixteen trial trenches were opened by machine within the 148ha development area.  The trench layout was targeted on features identified by the woodland earthworks survey.  The trial trenching showed that many of the woodland earthworks were poorly preserved.  The best-preserved boundary, to the west of Breakheart Hill Plantation, was dated to the early medieval period, and it is suggested that it may be contemporary with earthworks previously associated with a post-medieval pond complex further to the south.  Significantly, investigation of the earthworks around Fox Covert produced three sherds of residual late Bronze Age/early Iron Age pottery.  No traces of Watch House or Warren House were located by the trenching.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>An archaeological desk-based assessment (CgMs 2008) identified the potential for sub-surface archaeological remains within the site and recommended intrusive (trial trenching) evaluation.   The evaluation revealed the remains of three pits datable to the post-medieval and modern periods.  They were sealed by 0.45-0.62m of modern overburden and make-up layers.  The largest post-medieval pit contained peg tile, ceramic building material, animal bone and an abraded residual sherd of possible Roman pottery.  The function of these pits is unclear.  However, they may be related to the use of this land as the gardens or back-plots of houses and shops on West Street as shown on the 1843 Great Marlow Tithe map and the 1st edition OS map of 1876 (CgMs 2008).  They are considered to be of local significance.    The presence of a possible Roman sherd within the largest pit does not necessarily indicate contemporary activity within or immediately adjacent to the area.  The sherd was extremely abraded and appeared within a securely dated post-medieval deposit containing post-medieval tile.  The modern pit may be associated with the construction of 19th- and 20th-century ancillary buildings first shown on the OS map of 1876.  Alternatively it may represent re-deposited 19th-20th-century material moved during the construction of the Waitrose store in the 1970s.  These remains have no archaeological significance.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>An application for planning permission has been submitted for the construction of a new 6th form block at Aylesbury High School, Walton Road.     The first stage of the programme of archaeological work comprised a site evaluation by trial trenching.   One ditch of possible late Iron-Age date was found in the trial trench.  The lack of other features suggests that the ditch is an outlying settlement feature, possibly a field boundary.   This evaluation and previous archaeological work within the boundaries of the school confirm that significant remains are present throughout the area, although the lack of other features within the trial trench suggests a low density of archaeological activity in the location of the proposed new building.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Planning permission was granted for the dismantling of an existing stable and erection of a games room with associated works in the grounds of Parsonage House, Church Lane, Farndish.    Five stages of groundworks were monitored during the development:   No archaeological features predating the 19th, or possibly the 18th century, were revealed on the site.  No archaeological features were uncovered in the area of the paddock to the east of the new games room (Stages 1, 4 and 5).  Several pits and areas of ground disturbance were recorded in Stages 2 and 3, located in the garden of Parsonage House.  These are most likely to be associated with garden and landscaping works and possibly the construction of a new patio for the house.  The oldest feature revealed was the narrow foundation for a limestone wall within the footprint of the new games room.  This lines up precisely with the small stable block previously located on the site.  However, the construction of the foundation suggests a wall of greater antiquity and it is possible that it is more closely related to the foundations of a larger, more elongated stable block or outhouses along the eastern boundary of the present-day garden, which are shown on a map of Farndish dating to 1800.  The same map shows ridge and furrow cultivation in the area surrounding the Church of St Michael and Parsonage House.  Therefore it is likely that most of the deposits revealed during the groundworks are agricultural soils.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Bedfordshire County Council Countryside Access Service carried out improvement works to the rights of way network in the vicinity of the scheduled moated site near Hill House, Old Warden, Bedfordshire.  Consent for the necessary groundworks for a new footpath within the ancient monument was granted by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) on condition that they were carried out under archaeological supervision.    Groundworks within the scheduled area included the hand excavation of four holes for waymark posts and the hand excavation of two level indentations either side of the moat inlet channel for housing sleepers to support a bridge.  All works requiring archaeological monitoring were completed on 15th July 2008.  The waymark post holes measured approximately 0.2m across and were excavated to around 0.7m deep.  Clay silt topsoil and subsoil layers were observed overlying the undisturbed clay geology which was reached at approximately 0.6m beneath the ground surface.  The indentations for the bridge supports did not penetrate the subsoil, each only measuring around 2.5m long x 0.3m wide and up to 0.15m deep.    No archaeological features, deposits or finds were revealed during the course of the groundworks.  Although the groundworks were undertaken in close proximity to earthworks associated with the moated site, no archaeological remains were revealed.  However, given the small scale of these groundworks, there remains a strong possibility that buried features and finds associated with the moated site, still survive in this area.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Investigations by Albion Archaeology in 2008 at Westoning Lower School revealed numerous postholes, gullies and ditches, representing the remains of two phases of medieval activity.  The earliest phase comprised the partial footprints of three probable buildings dated by pottery to the 12th-13th centuries.  Their location suggests that a road on the line of the present-day High Street was already in existence by this time.  This road is possibly one of three focal points from which the village of Westoning developed.  By the beginning of the 14th century the buildings appear to have been abandoned and were replaced by ditches demarcating a NE-SW aligned boundary.  These had become completely infilled by the end of the 15th century, from which time the site appears to have been used as farm land until the construction of the school in the early 20th century.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>A planning application was submitted to Bedfordshire County Council for the extension of an existing dwelling at The Old Vicarage, 65 Church End, Renhold, Bedfordshire.   The development site lay within an area of archaeological sensitivity, within the medieval village of Church End and opposite the 14th-15th century All Saints&apos; Church.   As a consequence, a condition was attached to the planning permission requiring a programme of archaeological works comprising observation, investigation and recording be carried out as part of the development.    The archaeological works identified a number of archaeological features within the area of the development.  Most represented post-medieval or later features probably associated with the extant building.  Surviving amongst these features were two probable post pits that dated to the late medieval period.  These suggest the presence of a possible structure which would have been contemporary with All Saints&apos; Church.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>A pre-application archaeological evaluation was undertaken to investigate the area of a proposed lake to the rear of 2 Great North Road, Chawston.      Three trial trenches were excavated in the area of the proposed lake.  None of the trenches contained any archaeological remains indicating that the Development Area may lie in a buffer zone within higher concentrations of prehistoric funerary monuments, as recorded at St Neots and the Biddenham Loop, for example.     The exposed soils within the trenches showed the mixed gravel and sand deposits of the 1st River Terrace.  The site lies on the edge of the River Great Ouse alluvial soils, indicated by a relatively thin layer of alluvium which overlay the gravels in the eastern part of the site but petered out towards the western edge of the proposed lake.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Following approval of a written scheme of investigation  (Albion Archaeology 2009b), geophysical survey was carried out and recorded a single anomaly. Subsequently, a trial trench plan was agreed that would target this anomaly and sample other, apparently blank, parts of the area.    Trial trenching confirmed that this geophysical survey anomaly was not an archaeological feature. Indeed, no archaeological remains were revealed by trial trenching.  The results of this evaluation have demonstrated a low archaeological potential.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Evaluation trenches on land at Little Walden Road exposed very few archaeological remains.  One pottery vessel, dating to the late prehistoric period and deposited on the edge of an ancient watercourse, was revealed within the Development Area.  The deposition of the vessel probably represents the result of an isolated and chance ritual event.   The rest of the area was characterised by a post-medieval boundary ditch and several large post-medieval quarry pits.  The quarry pits were mainly concentrated to the west of the Madgate Slade where the geological deposits are more homogenous and consist of rich sand and gravel seams below a thick layer of sterile</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Albion Archaeology carried out historic building survey at the former ROF 16, Elstow. Following on from the building recording an Oral History Recording project was also undertaken with interviews taking place between March and June 2008.    Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF) no. 16 at Elstow was one of 16 large national filling (ROF FF) factories built between 1936 and 1942 (a further four were planned but not built).  Although many of the buildings were in a poor condition and a number had been previously demolished, the combination of a detailed inspection of the buildings, surviving war-time plans, the near-contemporary description of H E Bates and the memories of the oral history interviewees has allowed a surprisingly complete record of the war-time factory, one of the largest and most significant surviving World War Two monuments in Bedfordshire.  Buildings were recorded from each of the main groups present at Elstow: Group 10 administration and workshops; Group 5 Cordite then Shell Re-conditioning, Group 8P Pellet Production, Group 8 Bomb Filling and Group 9 Magazines.  A number of interesting features remained on the site including examples of spark- and flame-proof electrical fixtures and fittings, gas proof doors, war-time posters, processing equipment, steam pipe heating and black-out curtains.  Vegetation Clearance that took place in January 2008 revealed evidence of the former station platform, the 8P pellet processing area and the raised walkways and traversed buildings in the Group 5 area.   The oral history memories not only added depth and colour to the record but helped clarify aspects of life and work on the site.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Following a geophysical survey in 2009, the area was evaluated by twenty 50m-long trial trenches, sampling 2% of the area. These revealed a moderate concentration of pits, ditches and some possible post-holes in the southern half of the area, with only a few isolated remains to the north. At the southern edge of the site, however, next to the River Great Ouse, post-medieval quarrying has limited the potential for archaeological remains to survive.  Only a small finds assemblage was recovered from these features, much of which is likely to be residual. The available evidence suggests that the remains are prehistoric, dating perhaps to the Neolithic, yet the paucity of artefactual evidence means this cannot be concluded with confidence. A Neolithic date would make these remains of regional significance, yet an undated collection of such remains is only of low significance.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Planning permission is being sought for the demolition of existing buildings and the construction of twelve new residential dwellings on land at No. 3 Letchmore Road and an adjacent builder&apos;s yard, located within the Old Town area of Stevenage.   Due to the archaeological potential of the site the County Planning Archaeologist advised Stevenage Borough Council that a programme of archaeological work should be carried out in accordance with a written scheme of investigation (WSI) in advance of any development. The WSI (CgMs 2010b) identified the need for six trial trenches. Albion Archaeology was commissioned by CgMs Consulting to undertake the trial trenching.  The trenches were positioned evenly across the development area to determine, as far as reasonably practicable, the location, extent, date, character, condition, significance and quality of any surviving archaeological remains.    The results of the trial trenching indicate that there are no archaeological remains of interest present at the site.</dc:description>

The remains demonstrate that this land comprised low-density field systems and indicate the presence of a north-south aligned routeway. No evidence for intense human occupation or settlement was revealed. A geophysical survey was also carried out.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>The evaluation at Ashdon Road exposed the extensive demolished remains of Copt Hall Farmhouse, located within a landscape of post-medieval boundary ditches.  No traces of an earlier, medieval farmstead were revealed.  Along the southern boundary of the site an ancient palaeochannel was revealed.  It runs parallel to The Slade and represents a predecessor of that watercourse.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Albion Archaeology was commissioned on behalf of Northchurch Parochial Church Council, to carry out archaeological investigation and recording for drainage works at the Church of St Mary, Northchurch, Hertfordshire.    The church of St Mary dates from the late Saxon period, although the majority of the fabric is 13th-15th century in date.  The north aisle is the most recent construction, dating to the 19th century.  The ground-works comprised the excavation of a drainage trench along the north wall of the church, which was hand-excavated under close archaeological supervision.  The ground-works revealed a mixture of articulated and semi-articulated human remains by the north-west corner of the church, which are likely to predate construction of the north aisle of the church.  These were left in situ as far as possible.  The remainder of the trench revealed only disarticulated human remains, with no archaeological features identified.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Observation of drainage works at the church was carried out for the Parochial Church Council. No archaeological features or traces of an earlier church building were revealed within the groundworks.  Ground reduction and removal of a stone plinth around the base of the church exposed the lower courses of flint masonry that were identical in nature to the upper courses of stonework of the church walls. The top course of a flint pebble wall foundation that extended c.100mm outwards from the upstanding wall was revealed at this reduced ground level. No in situ burials were revealed and only a small number of disarticulated human bones were recovered from the French drain and the ground reduction works immediately adjacent to the church building. A varying number of disarticulated human remains were retrieved from Soakaways 1-3.  These were retained on site for reburial along with the small number of coffin nails and one coffin handle.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Planning permission  was granted by Bedford Borough Council for a new side and rear extension to the main house at 146 High Street, Harrold.  The works included demolition of the existing conservatory, excavation of foundations for the new extension and necessary services, together with landscaping associated with a new patio to the rear of the building.  The groundworks were monitored and consisted of the excavation of a set of foundation trenches for the building extension, a service trench and a soakaway.  No archaeological features were revealed at the back of 146 High Street, Harrold. Seventeen 12th-13th century pottery sherds, representing 16 vessels were retrieved during cleaning of the base of the foundation trenches. Such material is common in Harrold and the sherds are part of a general background scatter of pottery, most likely spread through manuring.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>The site lies to the immediate NW of SAM 407834, a Roman villa and burial ground. A Watching brief was undertaken during construction of a riding arena. Topsoil was stripped from the area of the arena and revealed a possible trackway on a NNW-SSE alignment. No artefacts were retrieved but the alignment of the trackway suggests that it may be Roman in date.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>The purpose of the works was to introduce a toilet and refreshment facilities in the church and to insert a new electric cable and a water pipe and also to construct a trench-arch drain to the north of the north porch. The works inside the church involved minor reduction of the floor level in the north-west corner of the north aisle. The external works comprised; machine excavation of a service trench around the west end of the church and machine excavation of trench for construction of an arch-drain in the church yard on the north side of the building. The trenches were machined by the building contractors under archaeological supervision.  No significant observations were made inside the building. The floor level was reduced down to the level of a concrete layer. Externally the trenches were cut through topsoil and undifferentiated subsoil/grave earth. A small amount of disarticulated human bone was recovered, mainly in the trench at the west end of the church. This was reburied in the church yard during the groundworks.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Bedford Borough Council proposes to develop land at 2a Castle Lane, Bedford.  The site is situated within the limits of the scheduled ancient monument of Bedford Castle Mound and Gardens (National Monument no. 20412).    Albion Archaeology was commissioned to undertake an archaeological desk-based assessment and field evaluation in order to determine the nature, likely date and significance of the archaeological remains on the Study Area.    The only feature identified as part of the castle itself is the moat, which lies beneath the northern perimeter of the Study Area.  No trace of a rampart survived, but evidence of medieval timber buildings and settlement was found.  A brick-lined well-shaft was an unexpected discovery; this was probably a well used by the 19th-century Castle Brewery.   The central part of the Study Area contained deposits of dumped soil c.0.5m thick that dated from post-1750.  These deposits have low archaeological value, but they provide evidence for the relatively recent use of the site.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Following approval of a written scheme of investigation  (Albion Archaeology 2009b), geophysical survey was carried out and recorded a single anomaly. Subsequently, a trial trench plan was agreed that would target this anomaly and sample other, apparently blank, parts of the area.    Trial trenching confirmed that this geophysical survey anomaly was not an archaeological feature. Indeed, no archaeological remains were revealed by trial trenching.  The results of this evaluation have demonstrated a low archaeological potential.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>BiogenGreenfinch are preparing a planning application for the construction of an anaerobic digestion plant on land adjacent to Royston Road, in Wallington parish, north-east of Baldock, Hertfordshire. An archaeological desk-based assessment was carried out by Albion Archaeology that demonstrated that the area had the potential to contain sub-surface archaeological remains. Following approval of a written scheme of investigation for these works, a geophysical survey was carried out (Stratascan 2010). This identified a single anomaly considered worthy of specific targeting during trial trenching. Following the geophysical survey, a series of geo-technical test-pits were opened and observed by Albion; these did not reveal significant archaeological remains. A trial trench plan was agreed with the CPA. It was designed to target the square anomaly identified by geophysical survey and to target other, apparently blank, parts of the area. These evaluative techniques showed that the area was largely blank of archaeological features. Two seemingly unrelated ditches were excavated 200m apart. The date and function of the ditches is unclear. They may be part of a prehistoric/Roman or medieval field system. The remains of a palaeochannel were recorded. In Trenches 11 and 12 the underlying chalk at the base of the palaeochannel contained several compact flint deposits; these may account for the geophysical anomaly highlighted within the survey. The anomaly was not caused by human activity.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Planning permission for the construction of all-weather playing fields and a multi-use games area at Great North Road, Alconbury included a condition requiring the implementation of a programme of archaeological works, due to the high archaeological potential of the site. A Design Brief issued by the Cambridgeshire Archaeology, Planning and Countryside Advice office stated that further information on the archaeological impact of the proposed work was required. Albion Archaeology was commissioned to undertake an archaeological field evaluation of the proposed development site. The development site lies in an area of Oxford Clay, overlain by First and Second Terrace River Deposits. Crop-marks adjacent to the site show evidence of medieval cultivation systems and house platforms (CHER 9036 and 10506). Medieval finds are also known from the area (CHER 801). To the north-west, within the same field as the proposed development, are strip lynchets and ridge and furrow crop-marks (CHER 798). The evaluation revealed the remains of previously unknown Iron Age and Saxon settlement activity, as well as medieval ridge and furrow earthworks, and a number of other features of archaeological origin whose date could not be determined. The Iron Age and Saxon remains are considered to be of regional significance. The depth of overburden is sufficient that the development will cause negligible damage to the archaeological remains, which will be preserved largely in situ beneath the development.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Albion Archaeology was commissioned to undertake a programme of archaeological investigation during groundworks associated with the construction of a nursery unit at Stephenson Lower School, Bedford.  The site is within the grounds of the school, which immediately prior to the archaeological work comprised an area of block paving, grass and flower beds..    The investigation indicated that below the deposits associated with the construction of the school, a cultivated soil profile had been preserved, indicated by the considerable thickness of surviving ploughsoil.  This sealed a substantial feature interpreted as a pit.  A small quantity of abraded Roman pottery recovered from the fill of the pit may not provide reliable dating for the feature.  The second phase of monitoring focused on the excavation of wall footing trenches and associated deep service trenches for the nursery unit, situated north-west of the car park.  .  Below various deposits associated with construction of the existing school, a buried soil profile was revealed, characteristic of a former arable soil.  Below this was a ditch oriented north-west to south-east.  Despite a careful examination of the excavated fill, no artefacts were recovered.  The nature of the fill indicated material derived from an unstable soil profile, typical of ploughing.  This ditch would appear to be a field boundary of uncertain date.  Observations indicated that construction of the school had resulted in less disturbance to the adjacent area than would be expected, with the old soil profile being buried under landscaping deposits. The two features revealed are of uncertain date, though they suggest low level human activity in the vicinity.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>In October 2007, Albion Archaeology carried out an archaeological field evaluation on land at Stephenson Lower School, Canvin Way, Bedford.  Previous investigations in and around Stephenson Lower School have unearthed remains from the Iron Age, Romano-British and medieval periods.  These remains include Romano-British kiln debris and Iron Age/ Romano-British settlement evidence from within c.300m of the development area.  The evaluation comprised one trial trench. Up to 0.7m of overburden was removed from the trench at which point undisturbed geological deposits were revealed.  No archaeological remains or artefacts were encountered.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>In 2006 Aspects Leisure Ltd obtained both planning consent and scheduled monument consent for an extension to an existing building at Aspects Leisure Park, Newnham Avenue, Bedford   Aspects Leisure Park lies within the precinct of Newnham Priory  The extension was constructed within the strip of land between the existing building and a free-standing brick wall dating from the Tudor period.  An open area excavation was undertaken in 2006 within the footprint of the proposed extension; Fragmentary remains of two buildings and related deposits were found at the northern end of the excavation, with two phases of cobbled trackway running southwards.  The earlier of the two trackways is believed to have been related to Newnham Priory and the later contemporary with a post-Dissolution mansion.     In 2007, precautionary watching briefs were conducted on drainage works and ground reduction for floodplain compensation.  In the event, no archaeological remains were affected by the works, confirming predictions made about the location, extent and survival of archaeological deposits in the affected areas.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>In 2006 Aspects Leisure Ltd obtained both planning consent and scheduled monument consent for an extension to an existing building at Aspects Leisure Park, Newnham Avenue, Bedford   Aspects Leisure Park lies within the precinct of Newnham Priory  The extension was constructed within the strip of land between the existing building and a free-standing brick wall dating from the Tudor period.  An open area excavation was undertaken in 2006 within the footprint of the proposed extension; Fragmentary remains of two buildings and related deposits were found at the northern end of the excavation, with two phases of cobbled trackway running southwards.  The earlier of the two trackways is believed to have been related to Newnham Priory and the later contemporary with a post-Dissolution mansion.     In 2007, precautionary watching briefs were conducted on drainage works and ground reduction for floodplain compensation.  In the event, no archaeological remains were affected by the works, confirming predictions made about the location, extent and survival of archaeological deposits in the affected areas.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Albion Archaeology undertook an archaeological field evaluation by trial trenching on land at St John&apos;s Street Bedford.    The evaluation has demonstrated the presence of archaeological features within the footprints of both proposed new buildings and the play area.  It has also successfully demonstrated the nature and state of preservation of the deposits within these features.  Multiple periods of activity were represented from the Saxo-Norman period to the post-medieval period.  onwards.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Planning permission was granted for the construction of two single-storey detached dwellings with garages and a new access drive.   The groundworks revealed two undated features of archaeological significance: a field boundary and a pit.  Also observed were numerous modern intrusions likely to be associated with the disposal of domestic refuse from the houses to the south of the development area.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>A planning application is to be submitted for the creation of a surface car park on land at Greyfriars, Bedford.  The proposed development site is located to the west of the suggested boundary of the Saxon and medieval core of the historic town and east of the Greyfriars Franciscan Friary.  It also lies on the possible course of the Saffron Ditch, an important early landmark and boundary in the development of the town.   During the 19th century a planned street grid was laid out and various residential terraces together with industrial/commercial buildings were constructed in the area.  Later during the 1960s this part of the town was extensively remodelled - the 19th-century structures were demolished and two tower blocks were constructed on the present site.    The trial trench evaluation confirmed that the foundations of the former tower blocks at the site were substantial enough to have destroyed any potential archaeological remains at their locations and that some deeper foundations were associated with the 19th-century development of the area.  The works also found that a considerable depth of overburden was present across the site.  However, no archaeological remains of significance were identified.    Although no significant archaeological remains were found, their presence at the site cannot be ruled out as preservation beneath the overburden, outside the footprints of the former tower blocks, is a possibility.  However, the current development proposals are unlikely to impact these potential remains because of their likely depth.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>A planning application (97/01163/OUT) has been granted for a mixed residential and employment development on land to the north of Stewartby.  The initial phase of archaeological work was carried out on the employment area as the proposed development is to commence on this part of the scheme first.   Albion Archaeology undertook the excavation of 14 trial trenches between 31st August and 3rd September 2010 in line with a brief prepared by the Historic Environment Team.  Two of the trenches contained the remains of late Iron Age activity.  This comprised a small pit and a heavily truncated ditch.  Six randomly distributed postholes were also identified in the vicinity of the pit, and may also date to the late Iron Age.  Two other trenches contained an undated shallow ditch and a post-medieval pit.  Traces of N-S aligned furrows were identified in eight of the trenches.  Given the extensive loss of land around Stewartby due to mineral extraction, the discovery of late Iron Age remains at the site has some limited value due to their rarity.  However, intrinsically, the remains uncovered by the trial trenching probably do not represent significant activity of Iron Age or later date and, therefore, further investigations at the site are unlikely to contribute to the understanding of landscape development and settlement patterns in the area.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Peterborough City Council granted planning permission (06/00338/FUL) for the erection of four industrial buildings, comprising nine units with associated delivery areas, parking and landscaping, on an area of 4.2ha to the south-east of Peterborough town centre.   Albion Archaeology was commissioned on 1st June 2006 by John Samuels Archaeological Consultants, on behalf of Wilson Bowden Developments Ltd, to carry out the archaeological observation and prepare a report on the results.   At the start of this development, the site was occupied by a disused sports field and the remains of bowling greens. It had previously been part of a brickworks.  No significant archaeological features or artefacts were revealed during the works, though only the foundations were excavated to an archaeologically sensitive depth. Disturbance from the brickworks was found to have been widespread, yet mostly shallow. The removal of only topsoil from most of the area has ensured that if archaeological remains exist within the site, they remain preserved in situ beneath the development.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Buiding works requiring monitoring comprised both internal and external excavations  Inside the church, the works comprised the removal of the floor and the reduction of the ground level by approximately 0.3m in the transept and 0.5m in an adjoining portion of the nave.  Outside the church the works comprised the excavation of three exploratory test pits, followed by pits for three soakaways and associated inspection chambers, and trenches for a French drain and connecting pipe runs.  The archaeological investigations found little of interest in the soakaway excavations. Disarticulated human remains and a possible grave were identified to the south-west of the church in one of the three soakaway pits  The excavation of the French drain trench enabled the full circumference of the church foundations to be recorded.  The full depth of the wall foundations were never exposed in the works, although they were deep enough to show variations in construction.  Re-used architectural masonry was present throughout the foundations as exemplified by the presence of finely dressed and occasionally moulded stones.  The excavation works within the church revealed several interesting aspects of its history including an early floor level in the nave, architectural elements of the chancel and transepts arches and the remnants of the demolished south wall of the nave.  Later additions to the church such as a brick burial vault were also uncovered.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>The Wingfield Pipeline Relay is part of CEMEX UK Ltd&apos;s Kensworth to Rugby pipeline renewal project. .   The archaeological works on the route of the pipeline identified a number of significant features located in the vicinity of a water course known as Sherrell Spring.    The majority of features date to the Roman period, principally the 2nd-3rd century AD, and include probable boundary ditches, a gully and a pit.  To the north-east of the Spring, an extensive spread of deposits yielded large amounts of building material and other artefacts of Roman date.  Although no structural features were identified during excavations, the presence of such a substantial amount of building material suggests a building is probably located nearby.  The range of artefacts recovered also suggests that the building is likely to be a dwelling rather than a more functional structure such as a barn or shelter.    A small number of undated features were also uncovered in the vicinity of the spring, including postholes and a large pit.  While the predominance of Roman features in the area suggests these undated features may also date to that period, activity dating from the prehistoric to Anglo-Saxon periods has also been recorded in the area.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Planning permission  for the construction of a Multi-User Route across Dunstable Downs was granted by Bedfordshire County Council.  Given the archaeological sensitivity of specific areas of the Multi-User Route, a condition was attached to the planning permission that required the implementation of a Scheme of Archaeological Resource Management (SARM).  This was prepared by Albion Archaeology (2007) in accordance with a brief issued by Bedfordshire County Council&apos;s Archaeological Officer (CAO).    The SARM detailed a programme of archaeological works to be undertaken prior to and during the development of the Dunstable Downs Multi-User Route.  These works comprised earthwork and photographic survey, trench excavation and watching brief.  Following excavation and survey, the series of linear earthworks visible at the north end of the Downs were shown to be old route-ways or hollow-ways containing wheel-ruts within their bases.  The number of hollow-ways and their size suggest they were created over a period of many years.  Some are likely to be precursors to the current highway, the B4541 Whipsnade Road, and probably date back to at least the medieval period.    Several quarry pits were recorded during the survey and excavation.  Chalk was commonly quarried for the &apos;manuring&apos; (marling) of fields and for supplying &apos;whiting&apos; (lime) works from the medieval period onwards.    A raised earthwork platform was recorded on the top of the scarp overlooking the Downs and may be associated with the known extensive past military activity in the area.  Evidence of Second World War gun emplacements have been found elsewhere on the Downs in recent years.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>The Brogborough Pipeline Relay is part of the CEMEX UK Ltd, Kensworth to Rugby pipeline renewal project. The c.700m section of new pipeline lies approximately 800m to the north-east of Brogborough.  These works comprised the archaeological monitoring of groundworks associated with the pipeline&apos;s installation, and the recording, investigation and reporting of any archaeological remains that were exposed.  The archaeological works identified two ditches and one large pit. Both ditches most likely functioned as drainage and/or boundary features and, although no dating evidence was recovered from either, their character, probable function and location suggest they are post-medieval or later in origin.  The function and date of the pit is not clear. However, post-medieval quarrying is known to have occurred in the vicinity therefore it is likely that such a large pit represents an extension of this activity.   None of the archaeological remains found during the pipeline works appear to represent features of great antiquity or unusual form. They are therefore considered to be of limited archaeological interest and significance.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Planning permission for the construction of nine dwellings at 12 Green Street, Willingham, has been granted by South Cambridgeshire District Council.   The initial phase of work comprised trial trenching.   The trial trenching was carried out in April 2011 and comprised the excavation of two trial trenchs located within the proposed development area.  The trial trenching uncovered two possible sand/gravel quarry pits, five post holes and two service trenches.  The quarry pitting is likely to be post-medieval in date and the post holes, modern.  The service trenches were related to the house and its outbuildings which were built around the turn of the 20th century.    Both trenches also contained several layers of redeposited material which collectively would have significantly raised the ground surface in the area.  This may have been necessary to level the natural topography or more likely to infill previous episodes of quarrying activity.    None of the archaeological features found during the evaluation are considered to be significant or of particular interest although the recovery of redeposited pottery sherds dating to High Medieval period is of note as it indicates activity of this date in the area, although not necessarily within the boundaries of the site.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Planning permission was granted by Bedfordshire County Council for the construction of a single storey extension to form three classrooms and ancillary areas at Stanbridge Lower School, Tilsworth Road, Stanbridge, Bedfordshire .   An archaeological evaluation consisting of two trial trenches was undertaken in August 2006 (OASIS id albionar1-17678).    On the basis of these results, the CAO recommended further archaeological investigation.  In December 2006, Albion Archaeology undertook a programme of archaeological mitigation works.    The remains comprised ditches forming part of a series of enclosures (which were re-cut on at least one occasion) and a single pit.  All of the features are dated by pottery to the early medieval period (AD1150-1250).  The ditched enclosures are likely to be the boundaries of closes associated with settlement ranging along the northern edge of a former village green.  The excavation produced no evidence for activity post-dating the early medieval period, suggesting that domestic activity ceased at that time.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Evaluation of an electricity cable trench diversion by fourteen 20m long trial trenches identified archaeological features associated with a nearby Late Iron Age/Roman settlement complex. The majority of these correspond with cropmarks identified in an earlier aerial photographic study, although additional ditches and some possible pits and a posthole were also identified. The only dating evidence was six sherds of early-middle Iron Age pottery, although it is assumed that the majority of the features were late Iron Age in date.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Albion Archaeology carried out an open area excavation in advance of industrial development at Butterfield Green, on the north-eastern fringes of Luton.  The earliest evidence for human activity took the form of late Neolithic/early Bronze Age and late Bronze Age artefacts.  Parts of an  early-middle Iron Age settlement and the fringes of a late Iron Age/early Romano-British settlement were also discovered.  There is evidence to suggest that at least some of the early-middle Iron Age boundaries continued to function into the late Iron Age/early Romano-British period.  A settlement of that date probably lay to the west of the excavation area.</dc:description>

The archaeological works required by planning condition comprise a building record of Block D and observation and recording of any groundworks associated with the construction of the new unit.   An archaeological Watching Brief undertaken during the demolition groundworks and any groundworks associated with the construction of the new building revealed no archaeological remains.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>In June 2008, Albion Archaeology was instructed by Bedfordshire County Council to undertake a programme of archaeological monitoring during the construction of an overflow car park on land to the south of the new Chilterns Gateway visitor centre on Dunstable Downs. No archaeological remains or artefacts were revealed during the development.  However, the majority of the groundworks were very shallow; the undisturbed geology beneath the topsoil only being exposed within the drainage trenches.  Given that previously revealed archaeological features in the vicinity were sealed by the topsoil, there remains a strong possibility that buried features and finds, including the potential remnants of the signal station, may still survive within the development area.  Any such remains are unlikely to have been adversely affected by the construction works.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Outline planning permission was granted in November 2006 for a residential development on land adjacent to Uffington Road, Barnack, Peterborough.   A condition on the outline permission required a programme of archaeological investigation to be instigated prior to development, which would be carried out in line with a Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) approved in advance by the Peterborough City Council Archaeology Service.  Albion Archaeology was commissioned by CgMs Ltd, on behalf of the developer David Wilson Homes (South Midlands), to carry out the archaeological investigations.  An initial stage of trenching was carried out, in line with the agreed WSI.  The discovery of two pits containing Neolithic pottery in one of the trenches led to detailed monitoring of subsequent development groundworks, excavation of a 10x15m area surrounding the pits, and excavation of further archaeological trenches to the north.  No further archaeological remains were identified in these operations.  The pits are of regional significance.</dc:description>

                    <dc:description>Archaeological field evaluation by trial trenching on the site of the former magistrates&apos; court at Verney Close, Buckingham.  The evaluation has successfully demonstrated the nature and state of preservation of the deposits encountered. These were largely post-medieval and modern in origin and highly truncated; they included wall foundations, domestic refuse pits, levelling layers and a probable quarry pit.  There was no evidence for medieval or earlier occupational, industrial or agricultural exploitation of the proposed development area.</dc:description>
